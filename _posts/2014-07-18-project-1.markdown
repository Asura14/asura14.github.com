description: With the goal to obtain financing for the pediatric building of S. Jo達o Hospital in Porto, <a href="https://github.com/J-Almeida/LGP-Joaozinho">'Uma App para o Jo達ozinho'</a>  is a simple yet enganging mobile game where the user collects different objects in order to create his own Hospital and share it with his friends. The game increases dificulty overtime and will only end when the user loses, meaning it can (in theory) be infinite. This mobile game was develloped using Unity and can be run on both Android and iOs.
